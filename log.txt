Running Bonobo v 0.2
Initiating window management system...
Done
Couldn't setup OpenGL, trying a lower version

Using OpenGL 3.3 with context options: profile=core, debug=false, robust access=false, forward compatible=false.
DebugCallback is not core in OpenGL 3.3, but might be enabled through an extension. However this is currently not supported by bonobo.
